#summary Let's study the bug we've met.

=== Introduction ===

Unfortunately, the WEAV you've gotten is not stabilized yet. We are very sorry about it, and we beg your help to make WEAV stable.

=== Log Messages ===
You can find log messages from the file you've set with the field name `DEBUG_MESSAGE` in your config.in file. If you want to see all the messages from your screen, you need to change your make file.

Your WEAV directory might be like follows.
{{{
> ls
config.in  debug_message/  Source0.2.9.3/  test_read_set/
data/      makefile        src/            weav*
}}}
Let's go in to *src/* directory.
{{{
> cd src
> ls
algorithm.c  common.h      edge_table.h  gpl-3.0.txt     perm.o      uniform.o
align*       config.c      edge_table.o  graph_travel.c  read_set.c  utils.c
align.c      config.h      em.c          graph_travel.h  read_set.h  utils.h
alignment.c  config.o      em.h          graph_travel.o  read_set.o  utils.o
alignment.h  copy.c        em.o          makefile        tags        weav*
alignment.o  del/          euler.c       perm.c          uniform.c
align.o      edge_table.c  euler.o       perm.h          uniform.h
}}}
Let's change makefile. You can find the following line from the makefile.
{{{
CFLAGS =    -ggdb -Wall -O2 -D__RELEASE__
}}}
Change it like below.
{{{
CFLAGS =    -ggdb -Wall -O2 #-D__RELEASE__
}}}
And, then 'make clean', change directory to WEAV, and 'make' it again.
{{{
> make clean
> cd ..
> ls
config.in  debug_message/  Source0.2.9.3/  test_read_set/
data/      makefile        src/            weav*
> make
}}}
Actually, WEAV produces many many log messages, but we 
intentionally mute them.
