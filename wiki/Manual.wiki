== Introduction ==

WEAV uses config.in file to set parameters, input and output files. However, it also allows you to use arguments list for your convenience. For example, you may specify K-mer length (`K=35`), debug message file name (`DEBUG_FILE=./debug_message/test`), maximum length (`MAX_LEN=10000`), and so on. You want to keep all the other parameters but want to change K-mer length to 50. Then, you can use command line to change the parameter.

{{{
./weav K=50
}}}

Or, if config.in file has everything you want, just type it as follows.

{{{
./weav
}}}

You can type what ever parameters like,

{{{
./weav K= 50 FILE_NAME=./data/test_file DEBUG_FILE=./debug_message/debug_test
}}}
