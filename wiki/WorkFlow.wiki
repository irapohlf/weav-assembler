#summary What you may follow to get assembled contigs.

== Introduction ==

WEAV is for transcriptome assembly which intrinsically has ambiguities. Therefore, WEAV implicitly assumes to use WEAV-CLUSTERING together. Because of this complicated process although WEAV-CLUSTERING is just a kind of pre-processing (compared to the other assemblers, but I would say that all of assemblers asks pre-processing and the assembly quality is really depends on the pre-processing step), you may get lost in the middle of assembly process.

I want to share the whole process in this page.

== Work Flow ==

=== Install Programs ===

==== WEAV ====
 * Compile: Refer <font size="2"> [http://code.google.com/p/weav-assembler/wiki/Compile Compilation Guide]</font>
 * Install: Move the WEAV executable file into wherever directory in your path. If you don't understand what this means, please refer other documents such as <font size="2"> [http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html What is PAT?].

==== WEAV-CLUSTERING ====
 * Compile: Refer <font size="2"> [http://code.google.com/p/weav-assembler/wiki/Manual_WEAVCLUSTERING Manual for WEAV-CLUSTERING] </font>
 * Install: Move the WEAV-CLUSTERING executable file into wherever directory in your path.

==== Utilities ====
_This is not yet uploaded. I will upload this as soon as possible. All the programs except weav and weav_clustering are one of utilities._

==== Test Dataset ====
I prepared a read set for this documentation which were sampled by 10 selected genes as follows.
