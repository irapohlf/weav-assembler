#summary What you may follow to get assembled contigs.

== Introduction ==

WEAV is for transcriptome assembly which intrinsically has ambiguities. Therefore, WEAV implicitly assumes to use WEAV-CLUSTERING together. Because of this complicated process although WEAV-CLUSTERING is just a kind of pre-processing (compared to the other assemblers, but I would say that all of assemblers asks pre-processing and the assembly quality is really depends on the pre-processing step), you may get lost in the middle of assembly process.

I want to share the whole process in this page.
